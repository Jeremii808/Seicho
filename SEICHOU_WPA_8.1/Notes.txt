Buttons that control visibility of images:

  - The image cannot be more than 1.35 mb, possibly even less, for reasons unknown. Otherwise, the application will crash.

Fonts:

  - If attempting to align text of two separate "runs" in a rich-text-box (ex. furigana), use a monospaced font (ex. Migu 1M).
